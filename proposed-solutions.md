## Introduction

This section outlines proposed solutions for implementing the business requirements of the TPRO network. This section, similarly to design considerations, tries to stay as high-level as possible, so it will not go into details on how to achieve mentioned solutions and/or what kind of tech to use, but rather how it should work on a functional level and how it should behave. This section is further divided into sub-sections, each dedicated to its own topic.

<a name="models"></a>
## Models

Models are structures used for modeling token ecoconomicâ€™s supply, demand and environment. Models need to be divided into two substructures: Model schemes (MS) and Model instances (MI). Schemes are structures that define the format of the model compatible with TPRO network, while Instances are schemes filled with actual data. 

Model schemes are administered only by the TPRO network itself in order to establish protocol rules and it may be possible for more than one scheme to exist at time. Model schemes are also not monetized as it is part of the protocol, meaning the access to it should be public and unencrypted. Since there is no monetization involved with schemes, the solution will require TPRO network to run a service that enables querying of the model schemes directly from TPRO network, not storage providers.

Model instances can be created by modelers, which are types of end-users. Model instances can be created in online and offline modes using TPRO application (or TPRO marketplace). Model instances contain specific data provided by the modeler, therefore in contrast to schemes, they need to be monetized. Monetization of models comes in two ways. Purchasing model directly from storage provider for local storage / other needs and purchasing model for use in simulation. Purchasing models directly from storage providers would happen between consumer and storage provider through dedicated proof. Purchasing models for simulation needs would be made indirectly through (TPRO simulation suite) in such a way simulation operator pays for simulation to TPRO, then TPRO delegates part of the payment to storage provider in order to access the model.

Due to the monetized nature of model instances, they need to be fully encrypted while stored within a storage provider, so storage provider does not have free access to the contents of the data (it is not able to workaround TPRO payments). Decryption of the data should be possible only by the original owner (modeler) or TPRO marketplace itself (while providing proof of purchase). Additionally, there needs to exist some kind of preview of models, that would contain unecrypted part of the original model in order to enable consumers to view it and use that viewing as decision maker whether to make or not make purchase (similar to how parts of PDF books are provided for free to incentivize potential buyer).

In relation to models, there needs to exist a ways for:
- TPRO (T) to publish model scheme
- User (USR) to retrieve model scheme
- User (USR) to publish model instance
- Storage Provider (SP) to store model instance
- User (USR) to preview model instance
- User (USR) to purchase model instance

<a name="simulations"></a>
## Simulations

Simulations are processes used by simulation operators to simulate the future behavior of token system, including token flows, allocations, performance, pricing and others. Simulations are by design performed by simulation operators that take input in the form of tokenomics instances, model instances and lifetime events. The output of simulations are the results that describe previously mentioned expectations.

Simulations can be performed by simulation operators, which are types of end-users. Simulation can be performed only in online modes using TPRO application (or TPRO marketplace). Simulations take data input from specific instances of data requested (chosen) by simulation operators, which needs to be paid far. 

Covering costs of simulations comes in two ways. First, when making a simulation the TPRO application (or TPRO marketplace) has to query requested data from storage providers, which needs to be paid from overall simulation fee. This is to ensure a constant revenue stream for modelers, tokenomics providers and Lifetime event providers, while reducing threats of potential piracy or repackaging (more on this in managing risks section). In contrast to simple purchases of instances, the purchases done through simulation are distributed by TPRO application (or TPRO marketplace) through Proof of Simulation. Proof of Simulation is intended to be a simple proof that wraps around multiple Proof of Offers and Proof of Purchases that needs to be distributed between multiple providers. The purpose for this proof is to enclose everything into one, atomic structure, ensuring that simulation either pays everyone, or it fails (if the fee specified by the simulation operator is not enough to cover all costs).

Aside from querying instances which are used for simulation, there is also the matter of processing resources, as simulation tends to be expensive in terms of processing power. Payment for processing power has yet another cost that is intended to be part of the fee, which similar to other fees will be enclosed within Proof of Simulation and paid to the processing provider. Since it is not possible to provide precise estimation on how much cost will be associated with the simulation before performing ones, the proposed fee model has to enable dynamic pricing and constraining. The proposed approach is to copy the solution blockchain platforms are using for processing contracts, meaning that the fee for processing power will consist of unit price which can be used for prioritization and limit on how many processing units can be spent in order to finish simulation. 
The maximum processing costs for simulation would then be equal to unitPrice*unitLimit. If simulation is performed before that limit is reached it finishes successfully. The chargeback for the unused fee should then be transferred back to the simulation operator. If simulation is not performed before the limit is reached, the TPRO application (or TPRO marketplace) should immediately drop its processing while providing appropriate error message and error code to the simulation operator. Storage fees for failed simulation should still be distributed to the storage providers, as they performed their service correctly.

To sum up, the cost of running a simulation should be covered by Proof of Simulation that will be provided by the simulation operator. Proof of Simulation should consist of, but not be limited to, choice of data instances to use and a fee for storage/processing. 
The overall cost of running simulation may be represented in following formula: cost = storagePriceForAllModels + processingUnitPrice*processingUnitLimit

Monetization of simulation, in contracts to data instances, would be provided in one way only. Purchasing simulation results directly from storage providers for local storage / other needs. Purchasing simulation results directly from storage providers would happen between consumer and storage provider through dedicated proof. 

Due to the monetized nature of simulation results, they need to be fully encrypted while stored within a storage provider, so storage provider does not have free access to the contents of the data (it is not able to workaround TPRO payments). Decryption of the data should be possible only by the original owner (simulation operator) or TPRO marketplace itself (while providing proof of purchase). Additionally, there needs to exist some kind of preview of simulation results, that would contain unecrypted part of the original simulation in order to enable consumers to view it and use that viewing as decision maker whether to make or not make purchase (similar to how parts of PDF books are provided for free to incentivize potential buyer).

In relation to simulations, there needs to exist a ways for:
- User (USR) to perform simulation
- User (USR) to publish simulation results
- Storage Provider (SP) to store simulation results
- User (USR) to preview simulation results
- User (USR) to purchase simulation results

In order to provide incentivization to use TPRO tokens throughout the network, the rewarding of different participants have to be represented in TPRO tokens. This section focuses on different revenue streams for each actor, to help the readers to better understand economic incentives.

<a name="rewarding-model-providers"></a>
### Rewarding Model Providers

Model providers provide TPRO networks with model instances which can be used for simulations and analysis. In order to define model instances, model providers require model schemes and access to TPRO applications, both of which are available to them for free.

Model providers pay for:
- listing fees which are used to cover on-chain interactions for TPRO marketplace and storage providers

Model providers are being paid for:
- Model instances purchases
- Model instances uses in simulations

### Rewarding Tokenomics Providers

Tokenomics providers provide TPRO networks with tokenomics instances which can be used for simulations and analysis. In order to define tokenomics instances, tokenomics providers require tokenomics schemes and access to TPRO applications, both of which are available to them for free.

Tokenomics providers pay for:
- listing fees which are used to cover on-chain interactions for TPRO marketplace and storage providers


Tokenomics providers are being paid for:
- Tokenomics instances purchases
- Tokenomics instances uses in simulations

<a name="rewarding-simulation-operators"></a>
### Rewarding Simulation Operators

Simulation operators provide the TPRO network with results of simulations that they schedule. In order to perform simulation simulation, the operator needs to select the models, tokenomics and lifetime events to be used within simulation which, depending on selection, may be paid or free, but most likely paid. In order to perform simulation, the operator needs access to TPRO applications, which are available to them for free.

Simulation operators pay for:
- Model instances purchases which covers modeler that created model and storage provider that enabled access to it
- Tokenomics instances purchases which covers tokenomics provider that created tokenomics and storage provider that enabled access to it
- Lifetime events purchases which covers Lifetime providers that provided events and storage provider that enabled access to it
- Processing power provided by processing provider

Simulation operators are paid for:
- Simulation results purchases

<a name="rewarding-analysts"></a>
### Rewarding Analysts

Analysts provide the TPRO network with analysis, which are interpretations of simulation results provided by simulation operators. In order to perform analysis, analysts have to purchase simulation results which are paid. Analysts also require TPRO applications, which are available to them for free.

Analysts pay for:
- Simulation results which covers simulation operator that created simulation and storage provider that enables access to it

Analysts are paid for:
- Analysis results purchases

<a name="rewarding-storage-providers"></a>
### Rewarding Storage Providers

Storage providers provide the TPRO network with storage space to store models, tokenomics, Lifetime events, simulation results and analysis results. Additionally the provide replication when multiple providers store the same data. 

Storage providers pay for:
- None

Store providers are paid for:
- Model instances purchases
- Model instances uses in simulations
- Tokenomics instances purchases
- Tokenomics instances uses in simulations
- Simulation results purchases
- Analysis results purchases

<a name="rewarding-processing-providers"></a>
### Rewarding Processing Providers

Processing providers provide the TPRO network with processing power to perform (compute) simulations.

Processing providers pay for:
- None

Processing providers are paid for:
- Simulations computations

<a name="rewarding-tpro"></a>
### Rewarding TPRO

TPRO provides applications and tools required for making models, tokenomics, aggregating Lifetime events and performing simulations and analysis. As TPRO protocol provider, TPRO is rewarded for each purchase or computation (a marginal fee on top of what providers make)

TPRO pays for:
- Application and tools development, maintenance and hosting that are not part of TPRO network blockchain monetization infrastructure

TPRO is paid for:
- Marginal fee on top of each purchase and computation

### Further Incentivization

In order to further incentivize network participants and strengthen the overall adoption of the network, TPRO may consider airdrops of tokens and/or competitions , both of which may divide amount of rewarded tokens based on participant activity on the network (judged by on-chain metrics available within TPRO network).

<a name="proofs"></a>
## Proofs

In order to properly implement the TPRO network, it will be required to implement a few types of proofs. Those proofs will be used in order to ensure monetization of the platform, efficient exchange of tokens in exchange for data, proof network metrics related to distribution and quality and, last but not least, incentive distribution of the network. All of the proofs will be provided within payment channels established between participants of the TPRO network.

### Proof of Offer (PoO)

Proof of Offer is a special type of proof exchanged between users that created any data instance that they wish to store on the TPRO network, including models, tokenomics, events, simulations, analysis reports etc. Proof of Offer main purpose is to broadcast to storage providers information that a new data instance has been produced that needs storage space, and provide them information on royalties that data instance author wishes to receive for use of the data.

Proof of Offer includes following information:
- information identifying created data instance
- publishing context including time-to-live for the offer (that has to match CR TTL)
- purchase price
- simulation royalties 
- listing fee (if applicable)
- other relevant information

Proof of Offer may carry payment information alongside it, but it is not intended for the data author to pay storage providers for picking up its data, as it may lead to malicious behavior including draining of data funds, false storage, false providers etc. The payment that may be carried within Proof of Offer is only meant to: a) pay TPRO listing fees b) cover storage providers costs associated with generation of Proof of 
Storage

<a name="proofs-pos"></a>
### Proof of Storage (PoS)

Proof of Storage is lightweight proof that is provided by a storage provider and settled on the TPRO network as soon as that provider modifies its storage. Proof of Storage is meant to broadcast information to TPRO participants about routing of data instances, meaning publishing the consistent information which data is being stored where, including replication information.

Proof of Storage includes following information:
- Information identifying stored data data instance
- Reference to storage information

Proof of Storage does not carry payment information alongside it. Costs of producing proof of storage is covered mostly by delegating context information to Proof of Offer that has been paid by the data author.

### Proof of Purchase (PoP)

Proof of Purchase is a proof that indicates purchase of a particular data instance from a storage provider. Proof of Purchase is the main revenue for storage providers and its is generated in two instances. First one, while the user wants to purchase information directly from the storage provider (for the purpose of using it off-chain) or while the user wants to use information while performing simulation (for the purpose of using data as simulation input). 

Proof of Purchase includes following information:
- Payer
- Payee
- Amount paid
- Information identifying created data instance
- Reference to storage information
- other relevant information

### Proof of Simulation (PoSIM)

Proof of Simulation is a proof that is generated when performing simulation. The main purpose for the proof is to ensure atomicity of operations that are performed underneath the simulation suite hood. In other words Proof of Simulation wraps all other  proofs which may be required for purchasing storage and/or processing power required for simulation, and enables execution of those payments all at once.
